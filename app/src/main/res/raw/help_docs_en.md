# Blue Screen Simulator Plus for Android
Welcome to Blue Screen Simulator Plus for Android! This is a simple utility for Android based devices, which lets you simulate various error screens from different Windows versions.
## Presets
This app uses presets, which contain settings about themselves (User configurations) and what operating system they should use and thus what options should be visible for the user (OS template).
These presets are stored in a list, which can be saved inside a configuration file.

The default presets are the following:
* Windows 11 (Native, ClearType) [Windows 11]
* Windows 10 (Native, ClearType) [Windows 10]
* Windows 8/8.1 (Native, ClearType) [Windows 8/8.1]
* Windows 7 (640x480, ClearType) [Windows 7]
* Windows Vista (640x480, Standard) [Windows Vista]
* Windows XP (640x480, Standard) [Windows XP]
* Windows 2000 Professional/Server Family (640x480, Standard) [Windows 2000]
* Windows NT 4.0/3.x (Text mode, Standard) [Windows NT 3.x/4.0]
* Windows CE 3.0 and later (750x400, Standard) [Windows CE]
* Windows 9x/Millennium Edition (Text mode, Standard) [Windows 9x/Me]
* Windows 3.1 (Text mode, Standard) [Windows 3.1x]
* Windows 1.x/2.x (Text mode, Standard) [Windows 1.x/2.x]

Each one of these presets can be seen in a drop down list at the main interface.

Selecting each one, will display a different set of configurable blue screen options.
As mentioned before, all of these options are stored inside the preset, meaning any
changes made in one preset, will NOT carry over to another preset
(e.g. if you disable watermark in one preset, it will be enabled in other presets).
