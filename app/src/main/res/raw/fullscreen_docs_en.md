## Fullscreen options
Blue screen simulator plus for Android allows you to adjust how a blue screen is displayed on your screen within the ADVANCED OPTIONS menu. Said menu looks like this:

![Fullscreen options](file:///android_asset/drawable/help_notch_options)

By default the Windows 11 blue screen might look like this:

![Navbar enabled](file:///android_asset/drawable/help_yesnavbar)

If you enable "Fullscreen mode", the screen will look like this:

![Navbar disabled](file:///android_asset/drawable/help_nonavbar)

If your device has a cutout for the camera, and you enable the "Notch area settings, the simulator will utilize the entire screen area, like this:

![Notch area enabled](file:///android_asset/drawable/help_yesnotch)

Easter eggs are secret features within this blue screen simulator, which may do some cool things, but you have to discover them yourselves (some of the easter eggs from the Windows version also work here). If you don't want easter eggs to work, you can disable that option.

By default, blue screens use bicubing scaling. If it looks too blurry and you want something blockier, you can use nearest neighbor scaling. Note that this will only work for pre-modern blue screens, as those use the device's native resolution and don't need to be upscaled.

Windows 9x blue screen with bicubic scaling:
